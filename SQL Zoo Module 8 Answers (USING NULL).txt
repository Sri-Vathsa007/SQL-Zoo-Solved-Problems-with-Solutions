                                                Module 8 - USING NULL


1. List the teachers who have NULL for their department.

SOL:  SELECT name FROM teacher
      WHERE dept is NULL;


2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

SOL:  SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
      FROM teacher 
      INNER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);


3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

SOL:  SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
      FROM teacher 
      LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);


4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

SOL: SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
     FROM teacher 
     RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);


5. Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

SOL: SELECT name, coalesce(mobile,"07986 444 2266") from teacher;


6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

SOL:  SELECT teacher.name, coalesce(dept.name,'None')
      FROM teacher 
      LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);


7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

SOL: SELECT count(name), count(mobile) from teacher;


8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

SOL:  SELECT dept.name, count(teacher.name)
      FROM teacher 
      RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)
      GROUP BY dept.name;


9. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

SOL:  SELECT teacher.name, 
      CASE
      WHEN dept.id = 1 OR dept.id = 2 THEN "Sci"
      ELSE "Art"
      END
      FROM teacher
      LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept;


10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

SOL:  SELECT teacher.name, 
      CASE
      WHEN dept.id = 1 OR dept.id = 2 THEN "Sci"
      WHEN dept.id = 3 THEN "Art"
      ELSE "None"
      END
      FROM teacher
      LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept;
