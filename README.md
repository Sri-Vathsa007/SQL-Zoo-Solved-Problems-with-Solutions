Greetings!

Feel free to explore my GitHub repository where I've shared detailed answers to SQL Zoo's practice questions. I encourage you to attempt the questions on your own before checking the solutions.

Note: It's recommended to challenge yourself first and refer to the answers when needed. The GitHub repository provides step-by-step solutions and explanations.

Happy Learning!!!
